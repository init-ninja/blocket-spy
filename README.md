# blocket-spy
blocket-spy can monitor the Swedish online marketplace `Blocket.se` as a continuously running process and post desktop notifications when new assets satisfying your search criteria are posted.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
This is an exploratory proof-of-concept website-scraping project. Scraping Blocket.se or other websites might be against the terms and conditions that you agree to as a user. It is your responsibility to check this! The availability of this tool does not guarantee your right to use it.

## ⚠️ Oh, and also... ⚠️
Unsophisticated website-scraping implementations like this project are susceptible to break when the pages being scraped (in this case, Blocket.se) undergo changes. Feel free to report issues or open pull requests, but be aware that things might appear to stop working momentarily or for longer.
